# How to take this assessment?

You have to create a React Native app in which you would implement one of the Models mentioned above.

We would assess the following:

 - UI to Code conversion Accuracy (Colors, alignments etc.)
 - Code Structure
 - Mock Functionality (Local JSON API etc.)

# How to Deliver Assessment?

It would be great if you can submit an APK for us to try on our devices Or You can record a Video in which you may demonstrate your work from your device or Simulator.
