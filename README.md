# How to take this assessment?

You have to create a React Native app in which you would implement one of the Models mentioned above.

Feel free to structure the code however you prefer and use third-party libraries at your discretion.

You can use any Mock APIs available online or Have any Local JSON Dummy Data.

**NOTE**
React Native must be used as the base library and the application should work in both android and iOS devices

We would grade the following:

 - UI to Code conversion Accuracy (Colors, alignments etc.)
 - Code Structure
 - Mock Functionality (Local JSON API etc.)
 
## Follow-up

Answer the questions in the [FOLLOW-UP.md](./FOLLOW-UP.md) file.

# How to Deliver/Submit Assessment?

- It would be great if you can submit an APK for us to try on our devices
- You can record a Video in which you may demonstrate your work from your device or Simulator.
- Share the repository of your code so we can review the code.

a member of our team will review and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.

Thanks!
